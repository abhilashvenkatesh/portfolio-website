## The Quiet Power of Boring Systems

There's a phrase I keep coming back to: "boring technology is a feature." When you're on-call at 2am and something breaks, you want the kind of system you can reason about in five minutes — not one that requires re-reading the design doc to remember why a particular choice was made.

## What Makes a System Boring?

Boring systems share a few properties:

- **Predictable failure modes.** You know exactly what breaks when X goes wrong, and you've probably seen it before.
- **Minimal moving parts.** Every layer of abstraction is something that can go wrong. Boring systems have few layers.
- **Dull but reliable dependencies.** PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka — tools that have been battle-tested over years and have enormous communities of people who've hit your exact problem.
- **Clear ownership.** Any engineer on the team can understand the system in a day.

## The Temptation of Clever

Early in my career, I loved clever. A bespoke caching strategy here, a custom protocol there. These were fun to build and impressive to demo. They were also, without exception, a nightmare to maintain.

The problem with clever is that it trades short-term complexity cost for long-term operational cost. The person who understands the trick leaves the team. The edge case the trick didn't handle shows up in production. The "temporary" workaround becomes load-bearing infrastructure.

## Boring in Practice

At Meridian Labs, we had a billing system that was embarrassingly simple: a PostgreSQL table with a double-entry ledger structure, a Celery worker to process events, and a Stripe webhook handler. No event sourcing, no CQRS, no distributed saga pattern.

It handled $2M+ MRR without incident for over a year. When something did go wrong, any engineer could diagnose it with a SQL query.

That's the win.

## The Principle

Choose boring technology. Resist the urge to solve interesting problems with interesting solutions. The most impressive system is the one that runs quietly for years while your team ships features instead of fighting fires.

*Save the clever for the product. Make the infrastructure dull.*

    summary: "After 3 years of production Go, here are the concurrency patterns I reach for again and again — and the ones I've learned to avoid.",
    content: `
## Go Concurrency Patterns I Actually Use

Go's concurrency model is elegant in theory and occasionally treacherous in practice. After shipping several high-throughput services in Go, I've settled on a small set of patterns that work reliably at scale.

## 1. The Worker Pool

The most useful pattern, period. When you have a bounded set of work to do concurrently:

\`\`\`go
func workerPool(jobs <-chan Job, results chan<- Result, workers int) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            for job := range jobs {
                results <- process(job)
            }
        }()
    }
    wg.Wait()
    close(results)
}
\`\`\`

The key insight: close the jobs channel when you're done sending, and let workers drain it naturally. Don't try to signal workers to stop — let the channel do it.

## 2. Context Cancellation Everywhere

If your goroutine does I/O, it takes a context. No exceptions.

\`\`\`go
func fetchData(ctx context.Context, id string) (Data, error) {
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return Data{}, fmt.Errorf("fetch: %w", err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    // ...
}
\`\`\`

This seems obvious until you're debugging a goroutine leak because someone forgot to pass context down three layers.

## 3. errgroup for Fan-Out

When you need to run N things concurrently and collect errors:

\`\`\`go
g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(ctx)
for _, item := range items {
    item := item // capture loop var
    g.Go(func() error {
        return process(ctx, item)
    })
}
if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
    return err
}
\`\`\`

\`errgroup\` cancels the context on first error, which propagates cancellation to all running goroutines. Clean and composable.

## What I Avoid

- **Goroutines without lifetimes.** If I can't answer "when does this goroutine exit?", I don't start it.
- **Unbuffered channels as semaphores.** Use \`make(chan struct{}, n)\` explicitly.
- **Global state shared between goroutines.** Mutexes are fine; races are not.

## The Mental Model

Think of goroutines as employees and channels as the work queue. The employee pool pattern covers 80% of concurrent work. For the rest, \`errgroup\` and context cancellation cover most of what's left.

    title: "PostgreSQL Performance Tuning: A Practical Checklist",
    date: "January 22, 2025",
    readTime: "10 min read",
    tag: "PostgreSQL",
    summary: "The same performance issues keep showing up in every codebase I've worked on. Here's the checklist I run through every time.",
    content: `
## PostgreSQL Performance Tuning: A Practical Checklist

Over the years I've worked on enough data-heavy systems to notice that the same five or six issues account for the vast majority of performance problems. This is the checklist I run through every time I'm handed a slow database.

## 1. Look at \`pg_stat_statements\` First

Before doing anything else:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
\`\`\`

This tells you where time is actually being spent. Don't guess. Every optimization effort should start here.

## 2. Missing Indexes on Foreign Keys

Postgres does not automatically index foreign key columns. If you have a \`user_id\` FK column and you're joining on it frequently, add an index:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
\`\`\`

Note \`CONCURRENTLY\` — it builds the index without locking the table.

## 3. N+1 Queries in ORMs

The classic. You load 100 users, then for each user make a separate query to load their orders. Use \`EXPLAIN ANALYZE\` on your slow endpoints and look for repeated queries with slightly different parameters.

Fix: eager-load related data with JOINs or use \`IN\` clause batching.

## 4. Bloated Tables from Updates/Deletes

PostgreSQL uses MVCC — updates and deletes leave dead tuples behind. If you have a high-churn table (job queues, session tables), check:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup,
       round(n_dead_tup::numeric/nullif(n_live_tup,0)*100, 2) AS dead_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
\`\`\`

If \`dead_pct\` is high, autovacuum isn't keeping up. Tune it or run \`VACUUM ANALYZE\` manually.

## 5. Connection Pool Misconfiguration

Postgres handles one process per connection. At scale, you want a connection pooler (PgBouncer in transaction mode) in front of Postgres, not 500 raw connections from your app servers.

A well-configured PgBouncer with 20-50 Postgres connections can handle thousands of app-side connections without issue.

## 6. \`SELECT *\` on Wide Tables

Fetching all columns when you need three is wasteful, especially on tables with \`jsonb\` or \`text\` columns. Always select the columns you need.

## The 80% Fix

In my experience, fixing missing indexes and N+1 queries resolves most performance problems. The rest of this list handles edge cases that appear at higher scale.

Run \`pg_stat_statements\`, find your top 5 queries by total time, and optimize those. Everything else is noise.

    readTime: "7 min read",

    content: `
## API Design Lessons From 5 Years of Breaking Things

I've designed a lot of APIs. Some were good. Most taught me something important by being bad. Here's what I've learned.

## 1. Name Things After Resources, Not Actions

Bad: \`POST /createUser\`, \`GET /getUser?id=123\`
Good: \`POST /users\`, \`GET /users/123\`

This seems minor until you have 50 endpoints and your consumers can't remember any of them. REST conventions exist because they create a predictable mental model.

## 2. Return Consistent Error Shapes

Pick a shape and stick to it everywhere:

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Email address is invalid",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Nothing is more frustrating than an API that returns \`{"error": "bad request"}\` from one endpoint and \`{"errors": [{"msg": "..."}]}\` from another.

## 3. Version from Day One

Even if you're only sure about v1, put \`/v1/\` in the path. It costs nothing now and saves enormous pain later when you need to make breaking changes.

## 4. Idempotency Keys for Mutations

Any endpoint that causes side effects (charge a card, send an email, create a record) should support idempotency keys:

\`\`\`
POST /v1/payments
Idempotency-Key: client-generated-uuid
\`\`\`

If the client retries due to a network timeout, the server returns the original response instead of charging twice. Stripe does this. You should too.

## 5. Pagination Defaults

Never return unbounded lists. Always paginate. Use cursor-based pagination (not offset) for large datasets — offset pagination breaks when records are inserted or deleted mid-page.

## 6. Be Boring with Auth

Use a standard: OAuth2, API keys, or JWT with standard claims. Don't invent your own authentication scheme. The security surface area of homegrown auth is enormous and the mistakes are severe.

## The Meta-Lesson

Good API design is mostly about empathy. Before shipping an endpoint, ask: "If I had never seen this codebase, would I know what this does and what to send it?" If the answer is no, keep iterating.
